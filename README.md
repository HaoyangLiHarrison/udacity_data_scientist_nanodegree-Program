Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post
Project Motivation

Hosting on Airbnb seems a viable source of income. To host or not to host, that is the question. As part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree, this project aims at bringing more clarity into decision making process by exploring the Seattle Airbnb Open Data from Kaggle and answering the following 3 business questions:
 

1. Who are the hosts?
2. Can hosting generate decent income?
3. Any tips to become a successful host?
